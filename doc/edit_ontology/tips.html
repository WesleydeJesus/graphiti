        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p>Here are listed a few common patterns seen in Graphiti ontologies.</p>
        <h2>Type pattern</h2>
        <p>Any object (that is a graph, a vertex or an edge) in Graphiti must belong to a given
            type. There can be as little as one type per category, for instance it is common to see
            only one type of connection between vertices. On the contrary vertices are often of
            different types, e.g. in dataflow applications you may encounter input and output ports,
            as well as instances. </p>
        <h3>"type" parameter</h3>
        <p>To model this behavior, Graphiti has a builtin "type" parameter that shall be associated
            with any object. This parameter should rarely be changed by the user, for different
            types often have completely different characteristics.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic behavior</h3>
